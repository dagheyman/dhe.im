I'm currently studying for the CompTIA Security+ certification. The scope of the certification is
quite broad, and I would recommend it as a general introduction to the field of cybersecurity. Since I 
have a technical/software background, most of my knowledge gaps are related to risk management concepts
and policy work. Everything on-prem and networking-related is pretty new to me as well.

I'll probably use this blog a glorified study-notes sometimes, by summarizing some concepts in scope for
the certification. My study material mainly concists of a hardback copy of the [Get Certified Get Ahead](https://getcertifiedgetahead.com) book (this site looks really shady...), which contains plenty of practice questions, and I get to experience the great feeling of using my physical marker pens in it. Together with that I've used a couple of Udemy courses that [my employer](https://visa.com) provides access to.

To pass the exam a 90% score is required, and my to recent practice exams I scored 76 and 82 %, so I still
have some studying left to do. I hope to complete this project before the summer.

I don't think I've read any literature on parenting since my son was born (about 4 years ago), but I recently
picked up Your Competent Child, and I must say it's been great so far. I appreciate text that holds a clear position,
and the idea of a danish family therapist explaining to me how I should treat my kids is very enjoyable.

The main point of the book is that kids are fully competent humans to (who would have guessed?) and deserve to be met
as such, instead of positive or negative behaviour re-inforcement. It stresses the difference between self-confidence (which is based on
what a person is capable of) and self-esteem (which is about self-worth).

Some memorable recommendations from the book include:
- Don't tell a kid that their drawing was beatiful, ask about the motive instead.

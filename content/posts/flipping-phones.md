I'm one of the most smartphone addicted people I know, which have been bothering more and more lately. I really do feel that the constantly available distractions, among other things, makes it harder to concentrate and focus. 

There was an [article](https://archive.is/AMwEe) (swedish) in DN recently, where the author described how life just felt _better_ after they switched to using a feature phone a few years ago.

My current smartphone is about to give up soon anyway, so I decided I will try a personal experiment.

Instead of using a smartphone I will use:

- A [Nokia 2720 Flip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_2720_Flip)
- A iPad mini (with SIM card)

The flip phone will function as my always-with-me-device, used for (semi)-urgent calls, emergencies and occacional text messages. I'll probably use it as an alarm clock as well, but we'll see how that plays out.

The iPad mini will let me keep all my iOS applications I depend on, everything from banking apps, password managers, messengers, you name it. Even some social media is allowed here.

The difference to just carrying a smartphone is that the iPad will not always be with me, and it should be used in a more active way with a clear purpose. This way I don't have to give up much in terms of functionality, but the setup will protect me from having all possible distractions instantly available to me in any moment in time. At least that is the theory, I will report back in a month or so on how the experiment went.

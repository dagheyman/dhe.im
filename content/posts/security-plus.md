I'm currently studying and preparing for the [CompTIA Security+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompTIA) certification.
The material is quite broad in scope, and covers quite a few parts of the cybersecurity domain. Since I am more of a software than a networking background, it feels like most of my knowledge gaps are related to firewall rules and physical servers. Many concepts in risk management and policy work are pretty new to me as well. It's been fun reading up on this, and I would recommend going for this certification to anyone interested in the field.

I'll probably use this blog as glorified study-notes, maybe summarizing some of the covered concepts. My choice of study material consists of a hardback copy of the [Get Certified Get Ahead](https://getcertifiedgetahead.com) book (this site looks really shady...), which contains plenty of practice questions. By buying the hardback physical version I also get to experience using real marker pens in it! It makes me feel like a student in the early 2010's. Together with that, I've also watched a couple of Udemy courses that [my employer](https://tink.com) provides access to.

To pass the exam a 90% score is required, and in my recent practice exams I scored around 85%, so I still
have some studying left to do. I do hope to complete this project before the summer.

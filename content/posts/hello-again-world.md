## 100 Days To Offload?

Apparently there is a thing called [_100 Days To Offload_](https://100daystooffload.com/) going on, with the purpose to get everybody to write more blogposts on their personal blogs. I'm in a Slack community where a few people are doing just this, and it got me a little bit inspired. I enjoy writing, and my experience is that it both makes it easier and motivates me to learn new things. So let's try it out.

The plan is to write about technology and security engineering, since that is what I do in my day-to-day, but who knows what will actually be posted here in the end. The format will be raw, unpolished, drafty and usually short.

Here is a list of things to consider when (re-)starting a personal blog:

- What static site generator to use (Hugo)
- Do I need to be able to _publish_ from mobile? (No)
- What domain will I use? (dhe.im)
- Where will the website be hosted? (Still unsure about this but let's start with GitHub Pages)
- Where will the repository be hosted? (GitHub for now)
- What's the name of the blog (notes on sec & tech)
